# About the Project

This is a project that I had made while I was preparing my article for the Sophie WeMP on "Simplified Insights into Projective Transformations and Image Processing". This basically takes an input image and applies a projective transformation on the image when provided the array containing the positions of the initial four points and their images. It converts the point positions into a numpy array and derives a transformation matrix out of it and uses 'opencv' to apply the transformation on the image. It then finally saves the output image in the images directory.
