# RIP-ONLINE-CLASSES

This is a project that was made by me when I was in class 9 and was giving the online annual exams.

## Description and Pre-requisites

This program basically creates a random 7 letter word and uses pyautogui to constantly rename the name of the zoom account currently in that meeting. The only pre-requisite (as you might have already guessed) is that the rename option must be enabled.

And once the name starts changing randomly, it is impossible to remove that person as the names are sorted according to the alphabetical order in the participants list. So you can basically unmute yourself and start this python program, and once the name starts changing. You can basically do whatever you want until your teacher goes crazy and decides to end the meeting lmao.

## Warning

The package pyautogui is extremely sophisticated and basically allows the program to take control of the movement of the mouse and the keyboard. Moreover, this project is not at all in development anymore and I am quite sure, that this will not actually run the way it is supposed to run in any computer other than mine (as the coordinates of the buttons and other things might have changed in this time-gap). And since I have not updated the code anymore from the time this project was made, the probability of this code failing to run is 120%. So run at your own risk if you want to lmao.
